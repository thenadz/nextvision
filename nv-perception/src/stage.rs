//! The [`Stage`] trait — the core user-implementable perception contract.
//!
//! Stages are the primary extension point for adding perception capabilities
//! to the pipeline. Each stage processes one frame at a time and produces
//! structured output.
//!
//! # Design intent: one trait, composed pipelines
//!
//! The library intentionally uses a **single** `Stage` trait rather than
//! separate trait hierarchies for detection, tracking, classification, etc.
//! This keeps the abstraction minimal and avoids a taxonomy that would
//! either leak domain assumptions or force awkward categorizations.
//!
//! Instead, the pipeline _composes_ stages linearly: earlier stages write
//! fields into [`StageOutput`] that later stages read from
//! [`StageContext::artifacts`]. Specialization happens by convention (which
//! fields a stage populates), not by type hierarchy.
//!
//! # What a stage should do
//!
//! - Process a single frame and return structured results.
//! - Read upstream artifacts from [`StageContext::artifacts`].
//! - Read temporal history from [`StageContext::temporal`].
//! - Populate only the [`StageOutput`] fields it owns.
//! - Remain stateless across feeds — internal state is per-feed.
//!
//! # What a stage should NOT do
//!
//! - Block on network I/O (manage async bridges internally).
//! - Mutate shared global state.
//! - Produce side-channel output bypassing [`StageOutput`].
//! - Depend on stage execution order beyond what upstream artifacts provide.
//! - Accumulate unbounded internal state (use the temporal store instead).

///

///
/// - `process()` returning `Err(StageError)` drops that frame and emits a health event.
///   The feed continues processing subsequent frames.
/// - `on_start()` returning `Err` prevents the feed from starting.
/// - A panic in `process()` is caught; the feed restarts per its restart policy.
